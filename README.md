# React-Native-DataCollectionApp
React Native app is designed to facilitate the collection of medical data in remote villages across Nigeria, where network coverage is often limited. The app enables healthcare workers to collect and store patient data offline, saving it as drafts when network access is unavailable. Once the user reaches an area with better connectivity, or the network becomes available, the app automatically transmits the stored data online, ensuring seamless data synchronization and reporting. This solution enhances healthcare delivery by bridging the gap caused by inconsistent network access.
